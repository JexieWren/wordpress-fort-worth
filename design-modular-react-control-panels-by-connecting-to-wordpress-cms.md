# Design Modular React Control Panels by Connecting to WordPress CMS

In the early days of my web development career, creating custom admin interfaces seemed like an insurmountable challenge. The ability to build modular, reusable components appeared to be a skill reserved for seasoned developers at large agencies. However, fast forward to today, and as a frontend developer at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/), I've had the privilege of working on numerous headless CMS-powered admin dashboards using React. The progress in frameworks and tooling has made once seemingly unattainable tasks accessible to a broader spectrum of developers.

One observation I've made is that while tutorials cover the basics of setting up a React app to consume WordPress data, they often lack guidance on architecting reusable, future-proof solutions. They also fall short in providing best practices for code organization, state management, and long-term feature expansion.

Having encountered these challenges firsthand while working on client projects at Hybrid, I wanted to share a comprehensive tutorial on building a fully-fledged modular admin dashboard. The approach I'll demonstrate revolves around separating presentational and container components, creating custom hooks for data retrieval and side effects, and establishing a sturdy foundation to seamlessly integrate new admin modules.

Instead of merely connecting to a REST API, my aim is to equip you with the skills to develop an admin application that adheres to best practices for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of practical techniques for designing modular React applications powered by WordPress as a CMS. No more guesswork or reinventing the wheel with each new feature.

## Setting Up WordPress as a Headless CMS in Fort Worth

The initial step is to install WordPress. You can either download and extract the files to your local development environment or deploy WordPress through a hosting provider. In my case, I'll use MAMP on my local machine.

Once WordPress is installed, you need to enable the REST API functionality. This enables frontend applications to interact with WordPress data via RESTful endpoints. Navigate to "Plugins" > "Add New" and search for "REST API." Install and activate the REST API plugin.

Next, you'll set the core API permissions by adding the following code to your theme's `functions.php` file:

```php
function allow_rest_requests_from_any_origin() {
  remove_filter('rest_pre_serve_request', 'rest_send_cors_headers');
}
add_action('rest_api_init', 'allow_rest_requests_from_any_origin');
```

This code grants permission for requests from any domain, which is crucial during development when your React app resides on a different origin.

The next step involves registering custom post types so that your React app can retrieve and manage customized content types beyond WordPress's core content types like posts and pages. We'll create a custom post type called "Projects" using the following code:

```php 
function create_project_post_type() {

  register_post_type( 'project',
    array(
      'labels' => array(
        'name' => __( 'Projects' ),
      ),
    )
  );

}
add_action( 'init', 'create_project_post_type' );
```

### Developing the React Admin App

To initiate our React app, execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell
npx create-react-app admin-app
```

This command sets up a basic React project that serves as the foundation for our admin dashboard.

The first component we'll create is "Posts.js," which is responsible for fetching and displaying post data from WordPress. In this component, we'll import the `useEffect` hook and make a GET request to the `POSTS` endpoint:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Posts() {

  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/wp-json/wp/v2/posts')
      .then(res => res.json()) 
      .then(data => setPosts(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <Post key={post.id} post={post} />  
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

This code snippet forms the basis of our WordPress-powered headless CMS setup, allowing us to render data in our React interface. In the following sections, we'll expand this application to support post creation and updating.

### Fetching Posts Data

The `useEffect` hook enables us to retrieve data from the API when a component is mounted. In this part, we import the `useEffect` hook and declare state variables for the `posts` array and a `loading` state:

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Posts() {

  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // API call 
  }, [])
}
```

Within the `useEffect` function, we make a GET request to the `POSTS` endpoint in the WordPress REST API. Once the response is received, we parse the JSON data and store it in the state. This triggers a re-render of the component with the updated data.

```js
fetch('/wp-json/wp/v2/posts')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    setPosts(data);
    setLoading(false);
  });
```

### Displaying Posts

With the posts data at our disposal, it's time to present it. We'll create a `Post` component designed to render each individual post. This component receives the post as a prop and extracts the relevant fields.

Additionally, we'll structure the overall layout and apply styling using Material UI grid, cards, and typography components. This results in a clean and organized interface.

Within the `Posts.js` file, we map over the `posts` state array and render a `Post` component for each post. This ensures that the title, excerpt, and other fields are displayed in an appealing grid format.

### Adding Posts

To handle post creation, we'll utilize the `useState` hook to keep track of input values and errors in the state. We define an initial state object and the necessary setter functions.

Validation and submission are managed through the Formik library. When a post is submitted, it invokes a `handleSubmit` function that triggers an API request to create a new post.

We'll also implement error handling to display meaningful error messages if the API request encounters issues. This approach offers a superior user experience compared to generic alerts.

### Routing and Layout

For defining routes and navigation within our single-page application, we rely on React Router. We initialize Router and define route paths for the main pages of our admin dashboard.

Common user interface elements like headers are abstracted into reusable components, `Header.js` and `Sidebar.js`. These components are rendered on every route using the `props.children` pattern.

Additionally, we conditionally display button links for adding new posts and navigating between sections using the React Router `Link` component. This ensures that all parts of our dashboard are interconnected within a polished and cohesive admin interface.

### Embracing Modularity

With the fundamental aspects of fetching, displaying, and managing posts in place, it's time to enhance our code's modularity and reusability. This involves extracting shared logic and user interface elements into custom hooks and components.

A logical starting point is the data-fetching logic. While our current approach includes `useEffect` calls directly within our `Posts` component, we can

 abstract this logic. Let's create a `useApiData` hook responsible for handling GET requests and returning the data:

```js
function useApiData(endpoint) {

  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(endpoint)
      .then(res => res.json()) 
      .then(setData);
  }, [endpoint]);

  return data;

}
```

Now, in the `Posts` component, we call this custom hook and streamline the component's code:

```js 
function Posts() {

  const posts = useApiData('/posts');

  return (
    <PostList posts={posts} />
  )

}
```

This approach renders our data-fetching logic reusable across other components as well.

As we expand our admin dashboard to include additional features, we can segment these sections into logical feature modules. Each module should encapsulate related user interface elements and logic in a self-contained manner.

Let's introduce a "Profiles" section for managing site users. We'll create a `Profiles` module with its own route and utilize the data-fetching hook:

```js
function Profiles() {

  const profiles = useApiData('/profiles');

  return (
    <ProfileList profiles={profiles} />
  );

}
```

By adopting this modular approach and developing reusable components, our codebase becomes significantly more organized and maintainable, especially as we introduce new features. Common utilities such as custom hooks prevent code duplication across the application.

This structure also enhances the customizability of our admin dashboard. Modules can be effortlessly included or excluded based on specific project requirements. Additional sections, such as settings, can follow the same pattern.

## Conclusion

This tutorial has guided us through the process of designing a modular React admin dashboard powered by WordPress as a headless CMS. By decoupling the frontend from the backend, adhering to best practices for component structure and reusable logic, and emphasizing modularity, we've established a flexible foundation for further enhancing the admin interface.

While the fundamentals of rendering and managing WordPress content are straightforward, the true value lies in creating long-lasting solutions. Building applications using techniques like custom hooks, feature modules, and the separation of concerns allows sites to evolve sustainably over time without the need for extensive code rewrites.

This approach is especially valuable for organizations like Hybrid Web Agency, which offers custom [WordPress development services in Fort Worth](https://hybridwebagency.com/fort-worth-tx/custom-wordpress-development-services/).
